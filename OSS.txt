Open source software (OSS) is computer software that is available to the public under a license that grants users the right to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code: 

    Source code: The part of the software that programmers use to control how the program behaves. 
this all softwares are used.
OSS is different from proprietary or closed-source software, such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Illustrator, where the creator or copyright holder sells the software to end users. 
Some advantages of open source software include:

    Faster upgrades: Programmers can usually fix and upgrade an application's source code in less time than with closed source.
    Collaboration: Users can contribute to and find new possibilities for shared data.
    Innovation: Open source channels drive innovation in areas like big data, blockchain technology, and cloud computing.
